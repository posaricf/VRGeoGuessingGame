A geographic location guessing game in virtual reality. Player is trying to pinpoint their location on the map as close as possible to the target location. Score is calculated as a difference in kilometers between the two locations. The goal is to have a score close to, or ideally, zero.

Locations are 360Â° pictures and the player has 3DoF.

The current game implementation has five (5) levels and no time limitation. Further iterations might include more levels, random location order, time limitations or even a multiplayer option.

The game is developed for Meta Quest and is playable exclusively with controllers.
